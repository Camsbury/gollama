<!--
Gollama is a tool I wrote for myself and decided to open source for others, it's not something I make any profit from or have received donations for.
I don't provide "support" but do consider genuine bugs and features and if they align with my goals and I have the time I try to fix them.

If you're able to contribute a fix, please consider opening a pull request instead of an issue.
